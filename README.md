The Event Registration Application is developed using Flutter and Dart. This application provides a user-friendly platform for college-level event registration. With a focus on UI and UX design, I created an intuitive interface that allows users to effortlessly register for various events.

Role:

As the sole developer and designer of the project, I was responsible for the following:
1. UI/UX Design: I designed an appealing and user-friendly interface, ensuring a seamless registration experience for users.
2. Coding: I implemented the entire application using Flutter and Dart, leveraging the framework's features and functionalities to achieve the desired outcomes.
3. Clean Architecture: I followed a clean architecture pattern to ensure a modular and maintainable codebase, separating concerns and promoting scalability.
4. Integration and Unit Testing: To ensure the application's stability and reliability, I conducted integration testing to validate the interaction between different components. Additionally, I performed thorough unit testing, employing a test-driven development approach.

This project served as a showcase of my UI design skills, as well as my proficiency in Flutter and Dart development. It allowed me to demonstrate my ability to create visually appealing interfaces while ensuring the robustness and quality of the codebase.
